Gold appears to be the most hated asset these days, no-one wants it or its
derivatives, e.g. miners, at any prices no matter how low they are. This will
stop, however, because the best cure for low prices is low prices.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Here are some facts:

  *  Gold has undergone over 35% correction from  all time nominal high
     ~$1900/oz in August 2011. Up to know, the lowest tick was in the last days
of June 2013 at just under ~$1200/oz below the [average production costs of
~$1300/oz][zhcost].

  2. What is more interesting, the gold forward offering ([GOFO][gofo]) rates
     were in backwardation up to three month: as of today, the GOFO rates have
been in a negative territory for more than a week. This has never happened
before, and the few times that GOFO rate were negative [for few days][zfgofo], namely in
1999, 2001 & 2008, marked the bottom of gold correction.

  3. The large cap miners trade at [discount to their book value][miners]. This
     is below what they were during the 2008 crash.

  4. The gold miners bullish percent index was [zero several times][bpgdm]
     in the  last half year. It's like no one wants to own gold stocks these
days.

  5. From the [commitment of traders report][cot] data, the number of commercial net short positions is
     ~19k contracts, the lowest since 2002.

  6. From the [Bank participation report][bpr], (major) US banks flipped from
     net short to net to net long in gold in the last 6 month of this
correction (see [this link][bpr1]). Barring any conspiracy theories, one may only wonder if smart money
know something that we don't..

   7. Chinese gold import via Hong-Kong is [higher than ever][zhchina].

No matter how one twists this data, some is clearly anomalous,
other may be suspicious to say the least, especially given current
macroeconomic enironment. In light of this, one might wonder whether gold is
mispriced. The sentiment is negative, and as of this month [Rick Rule
thinks][rickrule] we saw capitulation on behalf of the institutional investors.

This makes me wonder if this is how  market bottom looks...
