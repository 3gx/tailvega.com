I've doing some research to understand what has happened to gold price this
year.

As it is well know, gold has lost more than 35% since its ~1900 high in summer
of 2011, down to just under 1200 at the end of June. This is not far from ~50%
correction that gold underwent during 1974-1976. The question that makes me
wonder is the cause and sentiment is even remotely reminiscent to what we are
having in 2013.

Behold, as I will post here some factual data about gold 2011-2013 and 1974-1976.
