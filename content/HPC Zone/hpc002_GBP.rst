Today we received an email with sad news that our paper to SC13 in `Gordon
Bell Prize`_ category was rejected :(

It was an amazing project with an ambitious aim to model `Milky Way Galaxy`_ on
star-by-star basis using the `Titan supercomputer`_. While we weren't able to
accomplish this for the paper submission deadline, I am sure the  team will
simulate the full Galaxy in not that distant future on the full Titan.
