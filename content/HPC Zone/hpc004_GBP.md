Last year we tried, but did not succeed. This year is different, and our
submission was selected as a finalist for the [Gordon Bell Prize][gbp] at
the [Supercomputing 2014][sc14] conference.

It was an amazing project with an ambitious goal to model the [Milky Way
Galaxy][mw] on a star-by-star basis using the [Titan supercomputer][titan].
While we weren't able to simulate the whole Galaxy one a star-by-star basis, we
did simulated a slight smaller model with a total of 50 billion particles
using [Swiss Piz Daint supercomputer][piz]. This is the biggest 
Milky Way simulation by far (1000x more particles), and it provides wealth of
data to compare with observations.  Our application also achieved a sustained
performance of 24.8 Petaflops on 18600 GPUs on [Titan supercomputer][titan].
Once  the team will be able to secure more compute time, we have all the tools
at our disposal to simulate the Milky Way with about 50 billion stars (or about
300 billion
particles in total, most of the particle will comprise Dark Matter).
