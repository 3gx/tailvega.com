Imagine you can see the results of you calculations on a supercomputer in
real-time. At SC14 we showed, in the world's largest live in-situ visualisation
running on 1024 GPUs, that it is possible
([1][viz1],[2][viz2],[3][viz3],[4][viz4]).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

In collaboration with [NVIDIA][nvidia], [SURFsara][surfsara] has developed a
custom massively parallel volumetric splatting visualization engine. Currently
it has a single purpose to only visualize output from the [Bonsai][bonsai]
gravitational tree-code.  However, a lot of technology that was developed is
transferable to other applications.

The future plan is to learn from this experience about what is required to
achieve interactive supercomputing on scale. I'm currently writing a detailed
technical blog-post article about this to explain what we have done.

In the meantime, the source code of Bonsai renderer is available at
[github][bonsairenderer].
