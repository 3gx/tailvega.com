Today we received an email with sad news that our paper to SC13 in [Gordon Bell
Prize][gbp] category was rejected :(

It was an amazing project with an ambitious aim to model [Milky Way Galaxy][mw] on
star-by-star basis using the [Titan supercomputer][titan]. While we were not
able to accomplish this for the paper submission deadline, I am sure the  team
will simulate the full Galaxy in not that distant future on the full Titan.
