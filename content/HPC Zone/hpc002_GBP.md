Today we received an email with sad news that our SC13 submission to [Gordon
Bell Prize][gbp] category was rejected :(
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

It was an amazing project with an ambitious goal to model [Milky Way Galaxy][mw] on
star-by-star basis using the [Titan supercomputer][titan]. While we weren't
able to accomplish this by the submission deadline (we simulated 64
billion particle [Plummer model][plummer] on 4096 GPUs), I am quite confident
in the team's ability to simulate the full Galaxy in not that distant future.

Stay tuned, more updates will come.
